## Intro
If I haven't gone over the dusted folders of projects I have done in my high school, I wouldn't have picked up this Art Curation Project. As I look back to my high school career, I realized how much I have underestimated my own ability for website design. 

In this Art Curation Project that I cerated, I colllected works themed on fear and monstrosity across different time span and genres. As you go over the voices, think about the various definitions of monstrosity showcased, how these definitions get reflected in different times and genres, how they connect to and differ from each other, and finally, how these works impact and reflect about the reality that we live in.

Enjoy your tour!
